Here's a plan to get started with your React Native + Expo app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Photo Album Upload:** Implement the ability for users to upload photo albums. Since we're starting with the front-end, this will initially involve selecting photos from the device's gallery and displaying them in the app.\n*   **Preview and Payment Prompt:** Display the first three photos of an album as a free preview. After viewing the preview, prompt users to pay a fee in Rwandan francs to unlock the full album.\n*   **Elegant Home Screen:** Design a welcoming home screen that showcases available photo albums.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#000000` (Black)\n    *   Text: `#00FF00` (Green Hacker Font)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#A9A9A9` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#32CD32` (Lime Green)\n    *   Secondary: `#2E8B57` (Sea Green)\n    *   Accent: `#ADFF2F` (Green Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#121212` (Dark Charcoal)\n    *   Highlight: `#00FA9A` (Medium Spring Green)\n*   **Typography:** Use a monospaced font to mimic the \"hacker\" aesthetic. A font like \"Courier New\" or \"Roboto Mono\" would work well.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Create a component to display a photo album preview (three photos).\n    *   Implement a payment prompt that appears after the preview.\n    *   Style the home screen with the specified colors and typography.\n2.  **Create a new component for photo uploading:**\n    *   Implement a button that allows the user to upload photos from their device.\n    *   Display the uploaded photos in a gallery view.\n3.  **Modify `app/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Set the default theme to dark and apply the specified colors and typography.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T18:33:16.291621"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the \"Museum Show\" app for uploading and monetizing photo albums.

Now I've enhanced the photo upload functionality to make it crystal clear how owners can add photos. Here's a summary of how the owner can add photos:\n\n## How Owners Can Add Photos:\n\n### **1. Access the Photo Uploader**\n- **Header Button**: Tap the \"+\" button in the top-right corner of the home screen\n- **Create Album Button**: Use the prominent \"Create New Album\" button on the main screen\n- **Empty State**: If no albums exist, use the \"Create First Album\" button\n\n### **2.
