Here's a plan to get started with your React Native + Expo app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Photo Album Upload:** Implement the ability for users to upload photo albums. Since we're starting with the front-end, this will initially involve selecting photos from the device's gallery and displaying them in the app.\n*   **Preview and Payment Prompt:** Display the first three photos of an album as a free preview. After viewing the preview, prompt users to pay a fee in Rwandan francs to unlock the full album.\n*   **Elegant Home Screen:** Design a welcoming home screen that showcases available photo albums.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#000000` (Black)\n    *   Text: `#00FF00` (Green Hacker Font)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#A9A9A9` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#32CD32` (Lime Green)\n    *   Secondary: `#2E8B57` (Sea Green)\n    *   Accent: `#ADFF2F` (Green Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#121212` (Dark Charcoal)\n    *   Highlight: `#00FA9A` (Medium Spring Green)\n*   **Typography:** Use a monospaced font to mimic the \"hacker\" aesthetic. A font like \"Courier New\" or \"Roboto Mono\" would work well.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Create a component to display a photo album preview (three photos).\n    *   Implement a payment prompt that appears after the preview.\n    *   Style the home screen with the specified colors and typography.\n2.  **Create a new component for photo uploading:**\n    *   Implement a button that allows the user to upload photos from their device.\n    *   Display the uploaded photos in a gallery view.\n3.  **Modify `app/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Set the default theme to dark and apply the specified colors and typography.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T18:33:16.291621"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the \"Museum Show\" app for uploading and monetizing photo albums.
