Here's a plan to get started with your React Native + Expo app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Photo Album Upload:** Implement the ability for users to upload photo albums. Since we're starting with the front-end, this will initially involve selecting photos from the device's gallery and displaying them in the app.\n*   **Preview and Payment Prompt:** Display the first three photos of an album as a free preview. After viewing the preview, prompt users to pay a fee in Rwandan francs to unlock the full album.\n*   **Elegant Home Screen:** Design a welcoming home screen that showcases available photo albums.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#000000` (Black)\n    *   Text: `#00FF00` (Green Hacker Font)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#A9A9A9` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#32CD32` (Lime Green)\n    *   Secondary: `#2E8B57` (Sea Green)\n    *   Accent: `#ADFF2F` (Green Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#121212` (Dark Charcoal)\n    *   Highlight: `#00FA9A` (Medium Spring Green)\n*   **Typography:** Use a monospaced font to mimic the \"hacker\" aesthetic. A font like \"Courier New\" or \"Roboto Mono\" would work well.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Create a component to display a photo album preview (three photos).\n    *   Implement a payment prompt that appears after the preview.\n    *   Style the home screen with the specified colors and typography.\n2.  **Create a new component for photo uploading:**\n    *   Implement a button that allows the user to upload photos from their device.\n    *   Display the uploaded photos in a gallery view.\n3.  **Modify `app/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Set the default theme to dark and apply the specified colors and typography.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T18:33:16.291621"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the \"Museum Show\" app for uploading and monetizing photo albums.

Upload Photos (Two Methods)**\n- **Gallery**: Choose multiple photos from device gallery (up to 20 photos)\n- **Camera**: Take new photos directly with the camera\n\n### **3. Create the Album**\n- **Title**: Add a catchy album title (required, max 50 characters)\n- **Description**: Write a description of the album (optional, max 200 characters)  \n- **Price**: Set price in Rwandan Francs (required, must be > 0)\n- **Photo Names**: Customize individual photo names (max 30 characters each)\n- **Minimum**: Need at least 3 photos to create an album\n\n### **4. Enhanced Features**\n- **Permission Handling**: Automatically requests camera/gallery permissions\n- **Photo Management**: Remove individual photos, clear all photos, reorder\n- **Real-time Validation**: Shows character counts, price preview, photo requirements\n- **Progress Feedback**: Loading states and success messages\n- **Tips & Guidance**: Built-in help section with best practices\n\n### **5. User Experience**\n- **Preview System**: Users see first 3 photos for free\n- **Payment Flow**: Users pay the set price to unlock all photos\n- **Statistics**: Track albums created, photos uploaded, revenue earned\n- **Professional Interface**: Clean, hacker-themed design with green/black colors\n\nThe interface is now much more intuitive and provides clear guidance throughout the photo upload process.

Each album object will contain the album's title (e.g., \"Allan\"), description, an array of photo objects, a price, and a flag indicating whether the album has been purchased (`isPurchased`).\n*   Update the `PhotoAlbum` component (`components/PhotoAlbum.tsx`) to display only the first two photos if the album hasn't been purchased. Add logic to show a \"View More\" button or a payment prompt after the initial photos.\n*   Implement a `handlePurchase` function in `HomeScreen` that updates the `isPurchased` flag for a specific album. This function would simulate a purchase for now, but you'd eventually integrate it with a real payment gateway.\n*   Modify the `PhotoUploader` component (`components/PhotoUploader.tsx`) to allow the user to specify the album to which the photos should be added.\n\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T18:48:25.893770"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create five specific photo albums with limited free previews.
